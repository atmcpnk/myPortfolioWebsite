                    <p id='project-1-description'> This staging site was built for Apollo Green, it is an engaging and visually appealing website, showcasing a proficient blend of WordPress and Elementor for backend management, complemented by custom frontend enhancements using JavaScript, HTML DOM manipulation, and CSS. We utilized WordPress for robust content management, ensuring ease of updates and scalability. The platform serves as the backbone of the website, providing a solid and user-friendly framework for content organization. Using Elementor, I crafted a visually stunning and responsive user interface utilizing figma designs provided to me. This framework tool was pivotal in designing custom layouts and adding dynamic and repeatable content elements. Enhancing the Elementor frontend I utilized Javascript, and CSS to manipulate the DOM and style the content for extremely customized animations and scrolling effects. This direction also allowed for optimal viewing experiences across various screen sizes, taking a ‚Äúmobile-first‚Äù development approach as, according to <a href='https://techjury.net/blog/mobile-vs-desktop-usage/' target='_blank'>TechJury.net</a>, 56% of internet users and 73% of online sales are done through mobile devices. </p>
